      <p>
        - I cannot 100% guarantee that this program will work, if you encounter any bugs,
          please Email me at <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>e1086917@u.nus.edu</span> - i will try my best to resolve it ASAP.
          <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>Consequently</span>, you probably shouldn't take the results of these at face-value,
          it should be used as a supplement to your education.
      </p>

      <p>
        - This code is mostly targetted at students of <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>CS2100</span> from NUS,
          as most of my knowledge of <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>MIPS</span> comes from <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>CS2100</span> and it also
          inspired me to do this project.
      </p>

      <p>
        - Currently, the program assumes that your code <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>compiles</span>.
          I aim to add features to detect compilation errors in the future.
          (Although obviously, the program wont work if your code doesnt compile)
      </p>

      <p>
        - While technically the main purpose of this program is to <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>visualize the pipelining process</span> in MIPS,
          I have also implemented a <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>MIPS simulator</span> - the second row of boxes that is generated
          upon <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>clicking</span> the arrow button in the middle shows the outputs.
      </p>

      <p>
        - if your MIPS code involves <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>arrays</span>, you may notice that some of the outputs take the form 
        <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>'Mem Location'</span> - this is because I had to create my own memory management system for the
          MIPS simulator. You may <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>ignore</span> this - but if you are interested, Mem Location x refers to
          the x-th element that was declared (under .data) AND is part of an array.
      </p>

      <p>
        - if you intend to use some register, let's say $s0, to refer to the base-address
          of some array, A, of length n - then you must initialize that array under .data as
          A: .word <span style='color:rgb(247, 0, 0)'>A[0], A[1],..., A[n-1]</span> - and then
          add the instruction 'lw $s0, A' into your .text segment
      </p>

      <p>
        - currently <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>no support for .globl</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        - as of now - supported instructions are:
        <span style='color:rgb(60, 255, 0)'>
            'add', 'and', 'nor', 'or', 'slt', 'sll', 'srl', 'sub', 'addi', 
            'andi', 'beq', 'bne', 'lui', 'lw', 'ori', 'slti', 'sw', 'j'
        </span>
          i will add more overtime
      </p>

      <p>
        - for declarations under .data - <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>only .word is supported</span>,
          so if you have some declaration such as pi: .float 3.14159 - it is <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>not</span> possible.
          i aim to add this functionality soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        - all register values start off with a value of <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>0 by default</span>, if you want the program to start with another
          defined value for some register, you can do so by keying it in inside the respective input box that is auto-generated
          <span style='color:rgb(255, 0, 0)'>after</span> you key in your MIPS program
